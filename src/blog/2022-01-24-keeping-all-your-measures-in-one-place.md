So, you have created your last measure, every possible scenario has been thought about. You have created 35 measures and you are at peace with your report. You give it to your recipient who then asks you to add in a new page containing some of the measures you have created.
Wait, where did you put YTD Sales again? What about Same Period Last Year Units?!
ARGH!! where are they.
After 25 minutes of poking around you have finally found your measures and added the page.

What if you could save future you this headache?

Well, measure folders are your answer. Below I will illustrate just how convenient they are. Once you have set them up, you will do the same for every report you create going forwards.

So we start out having all our measures living wherever we created them in the first instance:
